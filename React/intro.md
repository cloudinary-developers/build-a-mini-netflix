# The MVP Challenge

An excited entrepreneur just approached you to build a video service. A service where users can quickly upload short videos and share on twitter for their friends to view. Let’s list out the features of this app.

**Features**

* Users should be able to sign up and log in.
* Registered/Logged-in users should be able to upload short videos of about 20 - 30 seconds.
* Registered/Non-registered users should be able to view all uploaded videos on the platform on a dashboard.
* Users should be able to share any of the videos on twitter.

Now, here’s the catch! **T’challa** of **Wakanda** wants to invest in some startups today, so the entrepreneur needs to demo the MVP of the video service in 10 minutes from now.

I know you are screaming your heart right now. It’s totally okay to cry and let the world know about your problems and challenges, but after much ado shedding tears, will the app be ready in 8 minutes? Well, sorry - tears can’t build an app!
